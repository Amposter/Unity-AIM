# UnityAIM

Autonomous vehicles are a popular area of study in machine learning that has seen great interest due to the increased funding by prominent companies. This purpose of this Unity3D project is to investigate ways to automatically produce decentralised car control-systems for future autonomous vehicle applications by using machine learning. 

UnityAIM is a simulator built to test the efficacy of using a deterministic approach called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) for coordinated driving against two decetralised approaches that uses neuro-evolution (NEAT and HyperNEAT). Each approach is evaluated by its ability to coordinate a group of vehicles through 10 different <a href="https://github.com/Amposter/Unity-AIM/blob/master/Appendices/Tracks/Tracks.md" target="_blank">tracks</a> that were modelled off real road networks.

## Instructions

The project is compatible with any version of Windows that can run Unity 5 or later releases. There are a few minor issues for Mac that are currently being fixed. The scenes for both experiments are similar, however each experiment implementation is done on a separate branch. Details are provided below:.

### AIM

The implementation of AIM is included on the 'master' branch. Once the project is opened in Unity, open the scene: 

__Assets/Imports/Demo Tracks And Controllers/track_composer.unity__ 

The parent object of all the tracks is located in the Hierarchy as **Tracks**. Once the **Tracks** object is expanded, enable only the track that you want to test. To do this, select the track and ensure that the checkbox next to its name in the Inspector is selected. Disable all other tracks by deselecting this checkbox for each of the respective tracks. In order to change the track parameters, expand the track object and select the **CarSpawner** object. In the Inspector, you'll find the variables that can be changed under the **Car Spawner (Script)**. The only variables that you should edit for testing is the **Test Duration** - the length of each trial in seconds and the **Cars Per Start Point** - specifies the maximum number of cars that can spawn at each entry point. Once you're happy with your setup, hit play to watch AIM in action. You may need to adjust the camera as certain tracks will be out of view. It is better to to switch to scene view once playing to zoom in/out or to view different parts of the bigger tracks.

### NEAT

The implementation of AIM is included on the 'StopGo' branch. Once you've switched to the branch and the project is opened in Unity, open the scene: 

__Assets/Imports/Demo Tracks And Controllers/track_composer.unity__

In order to run NEAT, select the **Simulation Controller** object located in the Hierarchy. Under the **Simulation Controller (Script)**, expand **Selected Tracks** and check only the index of the track you want to test. The variables to set the number of cars spawned and the trial duration is location under the **Optimizer (Script)** attached to the **Optimizer** game object. Once you hit play, you'll need to selected a controller to test by clicking the **Open File** GUI button. This will open a browsing window and you can then navigate to and choose a particular controller that you want to test. Each of the resulting controllers from the experiments are located in a folder named after the index of the track under:

__Assets/Resources/Best NEAT Controllers/__

Each folder contains 3 .xml files used to store the ANN controllers, 2 of them that can be selected to test. They are:

* **NEAT_Controller.champ.xml**:
This is the most evolved controller after 150 generations of training.

* **NEAT_Controller.SUPERchamp.xml**:
This is the controller that achieved the highest fitness throughout all 150 generations of training.

* **NEAT_Controller.pop.xml**:
This is the population of evolved controllers after 150 generation. As this is not a single controller, it cannot be selected to test and is included for later experiments.

Once you've chosen the controller you want to test, the simulation will start and each car spawned will use utilize the selected controller to navigate. You might again need to adjust the camera position for certain tracks.
