# UnityAIM

Autonomous vehicles are a popular area of study in machine learning that has seen great interest due to the increased funding by prominent companies. This project investigates ways to automatically produce decentralised car control-systems for future autonomous vehicle applications by using machine learning. UnityAIM is a simulator built to test the efficacy of using a deterministic approach called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) for coordinated driving against two decetralised approaches that uses neuro-evolution (NEAT and HyperNEAT). Each approach is evaluated by its ability to coordinate a group of vehicles through 10 different tracks that were modelled off real road networks.
